# ComputerCommons
A remake of the Computer Commons Webpage.

#### Deadline: Monday 11/20/2020

## Rules
1) Before pushing your changes, make sure you pull first. Fix conflicts, _if any_, then push your changes.
This way we won't cause conflicts on the repository.

2) We should each have gotten some amount of work. If you finish early, feel free to help others who need help.

3) Have fun! (lol)

## Other
Honestly don't know what else to put but I'll update the file if I missed something.
